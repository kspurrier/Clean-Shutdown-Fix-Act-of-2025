# Clean Shutdown Fix Act of 2025
**A citizen-drafted proposal to end the government shutdown responsibly and transparently.**

---

## 🏛 Overview

The **Clean Shutdown Fix Act of 2025** is a **nonpartisan, citizen-created legislative proposal** written in the same style and structure as an official U.S. House bill in hopes that it helps us move forward. 

Its goal is simple:  
> **Reopen the federal government immediately, without adding new spending, policies, or political riders.**

The bill provides temporary funding through **December 19, 2025**, ensuring critical programs — like WIC, SNAP, disaster relief, and veterans’ services — continue operating while Congress negotiates a long-term budget.

Both parties have legitimate reasons for holding out on things like this, even if we, the public mostly see gridlock.  Each side worries that passing short-term resolutions simply delays or prevents any efforts towards broader goals and forward movement.

## 📜 Why This Matters

When Congress fails to pass appropriations bills, the government “shuts down.”  
That means:
- WIC and food programs are paused.
- Air traffic controllers, federal workers, and military members go unpaid.
- Disaster relief and veterans’ programs are delayed.
- Families and small businesses face uncertainty.

This bill is a **clean continuing resolution (CR)** — meaning it simply extends last year’s funding levels without changing any policies or adding partisan “poison pills.”  
It restores government operations while maintaining fiscal discipline.

## ⚖️ What the Bill Does

### 1. Keeps the Government Open
Funds all federal departments and agencies at **FY2025 levels** until **December 19, 2025**, or until new appropriations are enacted.

### 2. Extends Essential Programs
Automatically continues existing health, veterans, and FDA programs at current levels, with no changes or new authorizations.

### 3. Ensures Federal Workers Are Paid
Guarantees **back pay** for all federal civilian employees and members of the uniformed services affected by the shutdown. The "Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019" (Public Law 116-1) permanently guarantees retroactive back pay for all federal employees after any shutdown, but it is worthy of inclusion as stated.

### 4. Protects Disaster and Veteran Services
Maintains full funding for FEMA disaster relief and Department of Veterans Affairs programs.

### 5. Promotes Accountability
Includes a **“Sense of Congress”** statement urging any Member voting *against* the bill to publicly explain their reasons for continuing the shutdown.
